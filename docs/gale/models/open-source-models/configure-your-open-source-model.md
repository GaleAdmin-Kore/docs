## Model Endpoint Timeout

The model endpoint timeout defines the maximum time allowed for a request to complete before terminating the connection. If a request exceeds this time, it fails and triggers a timeout error for the endpoint. You can set the timeout duration between 30 to 180 seconds, with a default of 60 seconds.



## Undeploy the Model 

You can undeploy the model if it's no longer in use. Undeploying the modle will result in an immediate disconnection from all active instances. Click **Proceed to undeploy** on the Configurations page and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Delete the Model

You can delete an undeployed model. Deleting the model will remove all the associated data. Click **Proceed to delete** on the Configurations page and follow the on-screen instructions.
