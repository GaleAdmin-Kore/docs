# View API Endpoint & Deployment History

## API Endpoint
After the model is deployed, the API endpoint is generated which implies that your fine-tuned model is ready for inferencing externally and across the other sections in GALE.

!!! note

    You will receive an email notification after your model deployment is completed and an API is generated and ready to use.

To view the API Endpoint, follow these steps:


1. Click the **Model Endpoint** tab in the left panel on the **Models** page of your fine-tuned model.

1. Click the **Copy** icon to copy and share the API Endpoint.

The API endpoint is available in 3 formats. You can copy and use the same as required.

### API Endpoint Usecase

You can use the deployed fine-tuned model in GALE for the following use cases:

* In the Prompt Playground to compare prompts against commercial, open-source, or any other fine-tune model.

* In an agent in the agent flow builder via the Gen AI Node.


## Deployment History


After deploying a model, you can modify its parameters and redeploy the updated version. The deployment history table tracks the complete life cycle of the model, offering detailed information for each version. This includes the deployment name, the timestamp when it was deployed, the deployment duration, the individual who performed the deployment, and other relevant details. 

Additionally, the system automatically appends a version number to the deployment name and increments it with each subsequent redeployment, ensuring a clear and organized record of all model versions and their respective changes.

For example, if a model named "Flan T5" is deployed for the first time, it will be named as "Flan T5_v1". Subsequent deployments will be named as "Flan T5_v2", "Flan T5_v3", and so on, incrementing the version number with each redeployment.

The most recent deployment is marked with a green ticket next to the model name. Click on any deployment version to view the details.

**General details**: This section displays the model's basic information, such as its name, description, tags, optimization technique, parameters, the hardware used, and deployment duration.

**Deployment details**: This section includes who deployed the model, the start and end timestamps of deployment, the deployment duration, and its status (Success, Failed, or Deploying). In case of a failed deployment, hover over “Status” to view the reason for the failure.

**Un-deployment details**: This section appears only if the model is undeployed either automatically by the system or manually. In the case of manual un-deployment, the person who initiated the un-deployment, along with the start and end timestamps of the process, is displayed.
