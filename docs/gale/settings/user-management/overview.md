# About User Management

User management within GALE operates on two distinct levels:

* **Account level**: At the account level, administrators can manage users with a broader scope, encompassing the entire GALE account. This includes responsibilities such as user registration, access control, and permissions applicable across various applications within the GALE platform.

* **Application level**: User management becomes more detailed and specific at the application level, concentrating on individual applications within the GALE platform. The owner of each respective application holds the authority to extend invitations to any number of individual users, customizing their capabilities in alignment with the unique requirements of each application. For more information about setting app-level permissions, see Manage user roles and permissions.
