# Monitoring

The **Monitoring** module in GALE helps track logs of events, actions, and changes across your account for the linked users based on the permissions provided to them for different modules. 

It provides visibility into activities and modifications for modules such as roles, integrations, models, agents, users, datasets, guardrails, and playground, ensuring that you can maintain oversight and respond to any issues promptly. 

Monitoring is crucial for maintaining security, compliance, and operational efficiency within your GALE account.

Monitoring supports the following features:

1. **Audit Logs**: Enables the admin to view the log entries of all the changes made across their account by the member users. [Learn more](./audit-logs.md){:target="_blank"}.
