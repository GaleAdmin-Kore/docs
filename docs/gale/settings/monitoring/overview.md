# Monitoring

The **Monitoring** module in GALE tracks events, actions, and changes across your account and linked users. It provides visibility into activities for modules such as roles, integrations, models, agents, users, datasets, guardrails, and playground. The monitoring system helps maintain your GALE account's security, compliance, and operational efficiency.

<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
