# Manage Nodes in Agent Flow

A flow consists of a sequence of nodes connected on the flow builder canvas. You can easily add nodes on the canvas, connect them, rename and rearrange them, and delete them as required.

### Add a new node

The Start node is the starting point of any flow and is available by default. You can drag and drop it (as well as any other nodes) anywhere on the canvas.

Click the “+” icon and select a node from the pop-up menu, or drag a node from the Assets panel onto the canvas.  <img src="../images/add-a-new-node.png" alt="Add a new Node" title="Add a new Node" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

### Rename a node

Right-click the node you want to rename and select Rename from the list of options.

### Rearrange nodes

Steps to rearrange the nodes on the canvas: 



1. Drag and drop the nodes to the desired location on the canvas, as shown in the demo below.

    Only the node that you are dragging will change position. Any connecting nodes will remain in place, regardless of the direction of their connection.

2. (Optional) You can right-click anywhere on the canvas and select **Auto arrange** to automatically arrange the nodes on the canvas.

    You can also perform other actions on the canvas such as Show/Hide UI and Show/Hide Grid by.

### Connect nodes

Node connections are either made from within each node's configuration or by dragging and dropping the nodes on the canvas. You can also connect nodes from the property panel of the node while defining the settings for success and failure. That will also automatically connect the nodes.

Steps to connect the nodes:

1. Click the grey dot that displays next to the node, drag your cursor over the grey dot displayed on top of the connecting node, and release. A line is drawn between the nodes, with an arrow indicating the direction of the node connection.
2. You can change the destination node by clicking the grey dot on top of the initial destination node and then dragging the connection line to the grey dot on top of the new destination node.

### Delete a node’s connection

Click the line connecting two nodes and click the **Delete** icon to delete the connection. The nodes remain on the canvas but will not be connected anymore. To ensure a working flow, you must create another connection between the nodes.


### Delete a node

Right-click the required node and select **Delete** from the list of options.
