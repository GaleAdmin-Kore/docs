# Configure an Agent

You can modify the general details of your agent, such as agent's name and description, asynchronous configuration, and environment variables. You can also undeploy as well as delete the agent, if it's not in use. 

## Manage Asynchronous Configuration

You can set the async mode configuration for the agent endpoint. If you change the mode, you must redeploy the agent.

Steps to enable and configure the asynchronous mode:

1. On the **Agents** tab, click the the **Agents** for which you want to modify the configuration. The Agent Flow page is displayed. 

2. Click **Configurations** in the left navigation and then click **Manage async**.

4. If you have changed the mode, you must redeploy the agent - go to **Agent endpoint** in the left navigation and click the **Deploy** button on the top-right corner of the page.  


## Manage Environment Variables

You can define reusable values and configurations for the agent using Environment variables. Those values
can be used by different nodes in the agent flow.


### Add an Environment Variable

Steps to add an environment variable:

1. On the **Agents** tab, click the the **Agents** for which you want to modify the details. The Agent Flow page is displayed.

    * **Value**: Enter the desired value for the variable.
    * **Notes** (optional): Enter any notes about how the variable should be used or its purpose.

4. Click **Save**. The created variable is listed on the **Create environment variable** dialog box.
