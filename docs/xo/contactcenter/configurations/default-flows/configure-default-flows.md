# Default Flows

The **Default Flows** feature lets you customize experiences for common events like welcome, transfer, or an unknown Intent.

Here, you can configure the interaction flow based on the customer’s behavior in two scenarios:

1. **Off-Working Hours**: When the customer tries to connect to an agent during off-working hours.
2. **No Agents Available**: When agents with specific skills, as required by the customer, are unavailable.

The contact center module provides inbuilt **Phone and Chat Experience** flows for these scenarios. However, you can change the default flow and the message to the customer based on the current conversation channel.

To start, go to **Contact Center AI** > **CONFIGURATIONS** > **Default Flows**.
