# Campaign Management

Outbound campaigns are reshaping how businesses connect with their audience. These campaigns proactively reach out to a curated list of individuals, following predefined rules. At the core of this process, calls are orchestrated based on the information available in a contact list. Outbound campaigns infuse a personalized touch by crafting scripts that shape the agent's interaction.

You can access Campaigns by going to **Contact Center AI** > **Campaigns** > **Proactive Outreach** > **Campaign Management**.

### Schedule Voice Campaigns

Scheduling allows precise control over when your messages will be delivered. You can seamlessly plan campaigns to coincide with peak engagement times, ensuring maximum impact. Whether daily, weekly, Monthly, or Yearly, tailor your schedule to optimize outreach and enhance audience responsiveness. Scheduling a campaign will activate the campaign at a designated date and time.

Steps to schedule a Campaign:

1. Click the **Schedule** tab and turn on the **Schedule Campaign** toggle.
<img src="../images/schedule-campaign-toggle.png" alt="Schedule campaign Toggle" title="Schedule Campaign Toggle" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">

2. Select the campaign **Start Date & Time**. **End Date & Time** is optional.
<img src="../images/start-and-end-time.png" alt="Start & End time" title="Start & End Time" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">

3. Select the **Time Zone** in which the campaign will be dialed.
<img src="../images/timezone-dropdown.png" alt="Timezone" title="Timezone" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">

4. Turn on the Recurrence toggle if you want the campaign to recur at defined intervals. You can select from the following options:
    1. Daily,
    2. Weekly,
    3. Monthly,
    4. Yearly.

    **Every “Enter Value” day(s)** is a subset of what you select, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly.

    !!! Note

        When a Scheduled campaign completes the first occurrence, it considers that run as complete so on the next recurrence it will start reaching the contacts freshly.
        For example, If a campaign is scheduled to run every week on Monday then on the first occurrence of Monday, the dialer will dial as many contacts as it can and then treat the contact list as completed. The next Monday the dialer will again consider dialing all contacts in the list.

5. Turning on the Allow Recurrence Precedence toggle will give the recurrence start and end time precedence over Contactable timings.
For example, if Contactable Timings are 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM but the user selects Recurrence Start Time as 8:00 AM, the campaign will start contacting from 8:00 AM.
<img src="../images/allow-recurrence-precedence.png" alt="Allow Recurrence Precedence" title="Allow Recurrence Precedence" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">

6. Click **Save**. A campaign is created as per the configured schedule.

    !!! Notes

        * When a timezone is selected in the 'Contactable Timings' section, it automatically becomes the default timezone for scheduling in the 'Schedule' section. However, campaign managers can still choose a different timezone from the dropdown if necessary.
        
        * Once a campaign is scheduled, it will become active at the specified date and time. However, the contacts will be dialed according to the 'Contactable Timings' time and timezone settings.
        
        * To ensure accuracy, the contacts are scrubbed again 15 minutes before the scheduled time of a campaign.
        
        * A scheduled campaign will automatically run at the scheduled date/time but the contacts are dialed as per the contactable timings and timezone. Clicking the Run button for a scheduled campaign displays an error message.

### Stop a Scheduled Campaign

Click the **Stop** button under actions. Stopping a scheduled campaign will end the instance of that campaign.
<img src="../images/stop-scheduled-campaign.png" alt="Stop Button" title="Stop Button" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">

A confirmation message is displayed. Click **Stop**.
<img src="../images/stop-scheduled-campaign-confirmation.png" alt="Stop Scheduled campaign Confirmation" title="Stop Scheduled Campaign Confirmation" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">

#### Agentless Dialer

Agentless Dialer maintains a queue of leads to be dialed and can automatically dial a new phone number. The dialer initiates an outbound call to the selected phone number and when a call is answered, the dialer connects the call to the configured voice experience flow. The dialer can detect answering machines or voicemail and reschedule the call by sending the call status to the campaign manager. If a call goes unanswered or reaches a voicemail with Answering Machine Detection (AMD) turned on, the dialer disconnects the call and automatically dials the following number on the list.

Metrics and call statistics, such as the number of calls made, call duration, and call outcomes are generated for monitoring and reporting purposes.

Campaign managers can customize the dialing pace, allowing them to set the number of simultaneous calls dialed at any time.

To create a campaign when Agentless Dialing Mode is selected:

* Select the **Start Flow** associated with the campaign. [Learn more](../../../flows/create-flows.md#the-start-flows).
<img src="../images/start-flow.png" alt="Start Flow" title="Start Flow" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">

    !!! Note

        * You can toggle on Answering Machine Detection if you want the system to determine whether the outbound call was received by an answering machine.

        * Using the agentless dialer, you can configure the [Automation Node](../../../flows/node-types/automation.md) making this dialer a differentiator from our competitors.

### Auto Dialers

#### Progressive Dialer

A progressive dialer is an outbound calling system that enhances the efficiency and productivity of agents. The dialer automatically calls the next number in a pre-defined queue immediately after agents complete their current calls. It ensures that one call is made for each available agent. For example, if 10 agents are free, it will initiate 10 calls simultaneously.

A progressive dialer connects the agent to the call only if a human answers, filtering out voicemails and busy lines. This gives agents time to review contextual information about the person they are about to contact, although they cannot control who they will speak to or the time they have for review.

The dialer efficiently manages lead allocation based on agent availability. It tracks agents’ statuses, ensuring the most idle agent receives the next call. It provides metrics and call statistics, such as the number of calls made, call duration, and call outcomes essential for monitoring and reporting.

Progressive Dialer Call Handling

Once the dialer selects a contact from the list, it dials the number and upon successful connection with the contact, the interaction is assigned to an agent. The CUSTOMER INFO widget displays the customer's information. the interaction appears on the [Conversation Tray](../../../console/conversation-tray.md) along with the campaign name.  
<img src="../images/dialing.png" alt="Dialing" title="Dialing" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:60%;">

During the call the agent can Mute, place the call on Hold, Transfer, or end the interaction.  
<img src="../images/call-connected.png" alt="Call Connected" title="Call Connected" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:60%;">

Dispositions are displayed to the agent when the call ends.  
<img src="../images/dispositions.png" alt="Dispositions" title="Dispositions" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:60%;">

 !!! Note
 
    Below is the dialing logic when the same agents are assigned multiple campaigns:
* If the campaigns have different priorities, the dialer first dials contacts in campaigns with higher priority and then campaigns with lower priority.
* If the campaigns have the same priority then it randomly selects contacts from the campaigns and assigns them to agents.
* Say there are two campaigns with Priority 5 and one campaign with Priority 4, the dialer will first randomly dial contacts from the two Priority 5 campaigns and after completing all contacts from these two campaigns it will dial contacts from the Priority 4 campaign.
