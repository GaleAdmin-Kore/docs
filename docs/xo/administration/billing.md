# Billing

The **Billing** section lets the Bot Admins view and track their Invoices and plan details.

### Billing Sessions

The Billing sessions are calculated based on

* Bot Usage (Usage Session)
    * A usage session is defined as ‘Fifteen minutes’ of user conversation with the bot. For example – If a user converses with the bot for 31 minutes, then it would be counted as 3 sessions (0-15, 16-30,31-End).
    * In the case of Human-agent transfer – If the user-bot interaction results in human agent transfer, the time spent with the human agent will be excluded from the bot session.

* Alerts Delivered (Alert Session)
    * Every alert delivered to a user will be counted as an Alert session. For example – If the user has set up to receive a sales report every 8 hours. In a day this user would consume 3 alert sessions.
