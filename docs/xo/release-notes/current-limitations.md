# Current Limitations

XO11 currently has a few notable limitations, which are listed below. Weâ€™re working on gradually removing these limitations and will update this list accordingly. 

* Universal Bots are not supported.
* Solutions like BankAssist, HRAssist, and ITAssist cannot be upgraded to XO11.
* Agent AI is available only for chat on third-party desktop systems, not voice.  
* The App language (display language) is available only in English, Japanese, and Korean.
* API Scopes have not yet been updated to the APP level; they still apply to specific products/modules.
