## LLM Integration using Dynamic Variables

The Platform now enables seamless configuration of both pre-built and custom LLMs by allowing you to use content, context, and environment variables, including the secured ones. Secure Variables, particularly for environment settings, function just as smoothly as the current system ensures.

Before configuring the LLM, ensure all necessary variables are set up. For more details, see [Bot Variables](../app-settings/variables/using-bot-variables.md).

!!! note

    Co-Pilot features can use content and environment variables. Dynamic Conversations features can use content, context, and environment variables.


### Key Advantages

**Avoid Misuse of API Keys**: By utilizing secure environment variables for API keys, the system minimizes the risk of unauthorized access. Properly configured permissions restrict visibility and usage to authorized applications or personnel only.

**Track Team-Wise Consumption**: Implementing tracking mechanisms for API key usage allows teams to monitor their consumption, enabling better resource allocation and identifying potential inefficiencies.

**Rotate Your API Keys**: Regularly rotating API keys enhances security by limiting the risk associated with compromised keys. A well-defined rotation schedule ensures that even if a key is leaked, it becomes useless after a predetermined period.


### Configure Pre-built LLM Integration using Dynamic Variables

!!! note

    * For Azure OpenAI, you can set the API Key, Sub-Domain, and Model Deployment IDs as dynamic variables.
    * For OpenAI and Anthropic, only the API Key can be configured as a dynamic variable.

Steps to configure a pre-built LLM using Dynamic Variables:



1. Go to **Generative AI Tools** > **Models Library**.
2. Choose the LLM you want to configure. For example, Azure OpenAI.

## Reset/Delete the Configured LLM Integration

If not using a configured LLM, you can reset/delete the LLM-specific integration using the **Reset Configuration/Delete** option. You can reset the pre-built integration and delete the custom integrations.

When you reset/delete the integration, the system does the following:



* Removes all the integration details like keys, endpoints, deployment names, etc.
* The system removes the model from the selection list of supported LLM features and turns off the respective feature. You can select another configured and supported LLM for that feature.
* Deletes the related Prompts and Responses.
