# Introduction

Business organizations use multiple sources to store diverse information and data. These sources include the company website, blogs, help centers, user guides, product catalogs, and sometimes, third-party knowledge bases. For instance, a company typically showcases its products and services on its website, accompanied by detailed information in the help center. Frequently, terms and conditions associated with these offerings can be found in PDF files or as FAQs on the website. Locating specific information can be a tedious task for the users. Kore Bot Builder streamlines this by facilitating the ingestion of different types of data from different sources, making it easier to find relevant answers from the comprehensive data set.

You can ingest data in the Search AI application from various sources using the following methods.

* [**Web Crawl**](./web-crawl.md): Extract and index content from websites. 
* [**Directories**](./directory.md): Index data from files in various formats like PDF, docx, ppt, etc.
* [**Connectors**](./connectors.md): Extract data from third-party applications like ServiceNow, Confluence, etc.
